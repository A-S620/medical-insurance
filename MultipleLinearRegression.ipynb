    "## Multicollinearity\n",
    "- Happens when the independent variables depend on each other or influence each other.\n",
    "- This makes it difficult to understand what is causing the results in the dependant variable.\n",
    "- When adding an independent variable consider the relationship between that variable and other independent variables\n",
    "- The best MLR model includes independent variables that are not correlated with each other, only with the dependant variable.\n",

    "- Too many independent variables that expalin teh variance but aren't useful to the model\n",
